# T-SQL for data analysis

The focus here is on T-SQL for data analysis needs. We cover the following:
	- Window Functions, which enables you to apply data-analysis calculations
	  in a flexible and efficient manner.
	- Techniques for pivoting and unpivoting data. Pivoting rotates data from
	  a state of rows to columns, and unpivoting rotates data from columns to
	  rows.
	- Grouping sets, sets of expressions that you group the data by. We cover
	  techniques for defining multiple grouping sets in the same query.
	- Handling time series data.
